#### Android Calculator Course For Beginners 

Hi welcome. Today, we will be building a fully featured Android Calculator app from scratch. **No previous Android Development skills** needed. We will be guiding you through how to build this app, starting from installing **Android Studio**, setting up your emulator (Virtual device), writting **XML Code** for your layout and last but not least adding **Java code** to power your app. 

We will be using just two files for this course which are, **activity_main.xml** and **MainActivity.java**. This course will also includes 3 BONUS (Easter EGG) sections.

This course will be dedicated to all Android Developers out there wanting to create their own Calculator app. No matter are you a beginner or not, we will still greatly appreciate your contribution to this project. Feel free to make some changes like adding more BONUS components and pull request us

If you are ready, let me guide you through to familiarize how this app works and where do you start.
